Keystore generation
After discussing the basics regarding security in Java, we may proceed to the generation of private and public keys for our microservices. Just like before, we will use the command-line tool provided under JRE—keytool. Let's begin with a well-known command for generating a keystore file with a key pair. One KeyStore is generated for a discovery server, and a second for the one selected microservice, in this particular case, for account-service:

keytool -genkey -alias account -store  type JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore account.jks -validity 3650
keytool -genkey -alias discovery -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore discovery.jks -validity 3650
Then, the self-signed certificate has to be exported from a KeyStore to a file—for example, with a .cer or .crt extension. You will then be prompted for the password you provided during the KeyStore's generation:

keytool -exportcert -alias account -keystore account.jks -file account.cer
keytool -exportcert -alias discovery -keystore discovery.jks -file discovery.cer
The certificate corresponding to the public key has been extracted from the KeyStore, so now it can be distributed to all interested parties. The public certificate from account-service should be included in the discovery server's trustStore and vice-versa:

keytool -importcert -alias discovery -keystore account.jks -file discovery.cer
keytool -importcert -alias account -keystore discovery.jks -file account.cer
The same steps that were performed for account-service have to be repeated for each subsequent microservice that registers itself in the Eureka server. Here are the keytool's commands used for generating SSL keys and certificates for order-service:

keytool -genkey -alias order -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore order.jks -validity 3650
keytool -exportcert -alias order -keystore order.jks -file order.cer
keytool -importcert -alias discovery -keystore order.jks -file discovery.cer
keytool -importcert -alias order -keystore discovery.jks -file order.cer
